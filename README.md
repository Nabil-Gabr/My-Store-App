# Store App

The Store App is a product management application built using Flutter. In this project, I used an API developed by a backend developer.

## Features
- Display a list of products.
- Add and update products.
- Delete products.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- Flutter
- REST API
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Postman for testing and executing requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

## What I Learned
- Handling API requests with Flutter.
- Using Postman for testing and analyzing responses.
- Implementing OOP concepts in Flutter development.
